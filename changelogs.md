# Changelogs

## v1.3.2
Initial release! ðŸŽ‰<br><br>
Each version name of the plugin should be synced with the sm64coopdx version it's being based on.<br><br>
So, for example, when sm64coopdx `v1.4.0` comes out, the next version of the plugin will also be `v1.4.0`. This makes it easier to know if that version of the plugin is up to date with a certain version of sm64coopdx or not.<br>
### Changes:
* Added all functions and constants present in sm64coopdx `v1.3.2`.
