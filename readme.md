# sm64coopdx Lua Autocomplete (for Acode)

Autocompletion system based on the [**sm64coopdx Lua API**](https://github.com/coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx/blob/main/docs/lua/lua.md) for Acode, a mobile code editor, to help mobile modders.
> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This only covers the `main` releases of the game and doesn't include any new stuff from `dev` builds — if you're using a developing (unreleased) version of the game, **this plugin WILL lack the newest available functions and constants of it.**

* This plugin was built and tested with **Acode v1.11.4 (962)**. You may need this or a higher version for it to work properly.

### Currently supports:
* Functions;
* Constants;
* Hooks;
* Structs and globals.

## Usage

Just start typing an existing function, constant or struct from the game's Lua API, and it will automatically show you all the available options that contain the characters you typed, so you can select one of them to autocomplete your input. A simple, yet handy autocompleter plugin. Nothing more.

## Other

This plugin should only help you typing functions, constants and structs faster (and maybe even find stuff you didn't know existed) without having to type their full exact names. It was **NOT** made to teach you Lua or how to use the game's Lua API. If you want to actually learn these, take some of your time to check the [official Lua website](https://lua.org/), read the sm64coopdx Lua API (linked at the top), and [join Coop Central](https://discord.gg/n8Tq484rnd), the official sm64coopdx Discord server, to ask for help with modding at `#coop-mod-discussion`.
